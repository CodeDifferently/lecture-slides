### Angle Brackets
* (the greater than & less than symbols “<” & “>”) The  “<>” tells the web browser that “this is an html tag.”

-
-
### Names
* The name of the tag that is usually an abbreviation of a word or phrase that says what it does.
* For example `<p>` is an abbreviation for paragraph

### Attributes
* Attributes are specific to tags and add additional information telling the browser what to do in the context of that tag.


-
#### Attribute Values
* Very specific information for a tag attribute
* Should always be enclosed in double quotes or single quotes


-
##### Example
* <p  color="#ff0000"> paragraph will be red because of the attribute and value we gave it </p>
* `<p color="#ff0000">`

### Opening and Closing Tags
* All elements have as opening tag with the same name of the element at the beginning.
* Attributes and their value are added in the opening tag.
* The content that follows the opening tag is the child of the element.
* The closing tag has the name of the element with a forward slash before it.

#####Example
<img src="img/open-close-tag.png">


-
#### Self-Closing Tags
* Some elements do not contain content or children and do not need a closing tag.
* `<img>` tags do not have a closing tag.
