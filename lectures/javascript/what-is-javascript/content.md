### What is the Internet?
* Set of _interconnected devices_
* product of _client-server relationship_
* enforces standard _communication protocols_

-
#### Set of interconnected computers
* Internet is the product of _**client-server relationships**_
* Client is a requester of information.
* Server is a sender of information.
* This very simple dynamic is the innerworkings of the entire internet.

-
#### Client (Information Requester)
* To view a webpage, a client must first send a request to a _server_.
* Requests are sent in the form of an _HTTP_ message requesting access to view an _HTML document_.


-
#### Server (Information Sender)
* Provider, servicer, or most commonly a _server_ of information.
* Servers await communications from client.
    * This waiting for a request is called _listening_.
* Requests are responded to in the form of _HTTP_ messages and subsequently a viewable _HTML document_ or _webpage_.

### What is HTML
* Standard _mark up_ language used to display documents in a web browser.
* Inspired by the _marking up_ of paper manuscripts
    * (i.e. - revision instructions by editors before any final print)
* Each of these marked up documents are called _HTML documents_, and they form _web pages_ when being _hosted_ by a _server_.


-
#### Manuscript Revision Instructions
* Manuscript mark-ups use symbols which _encapsulate_ a section of a document to annotate how the section should be handled.
* Encaspsulating sections allows structure to be enforced on document _as a group_.

-
#### Cascading Style Sheet Instructions
* Manuscript mark-ups often used the same symbol in different colors to denote more specific ways of handling the same issue.
    * These colors had a _cascading_ effect on the _mark up tags_ in the manuscripts.
        * <font color="blue">¶</font> - Create new paragraph, indent once
        * <font color="red">¶</font> - Create new paragraph, indent twice
