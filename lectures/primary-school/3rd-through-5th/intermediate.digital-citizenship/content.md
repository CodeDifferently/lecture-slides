#### The Power of Words
* Words can be interpreted differently by different people. It is important to think about the words we use and how they affect people.

your family and friends will not be the same with other people.

#### How to respond to Cyberbullying
* What are some ways to respond to cyberbullying?

-

#### Do not respond
* A cyberbully's intention is not only to hurt another person's feelings but to also get a response.
* Refusing to respond to a cyberbully allows you to uphold yourself to a higher standard than them.
* In most situations, a cyberbully that does not receive a response will more than likely stop the bullying.
* Logging off the website, app, or game at the moment of cyberbullying may help as well.

-
#### Block the Cyberbully
* Blocking the cyberbully is one way to prevent the person from sending you messages in the future.

-
#### Tell an Adult
* There are cyberbullies that will continually bully someone even if the previous steps are followed.
* If you encounter a cyberbully that does not stop, it is important to tell an adult you trust for assistance.
* You do not have to fight the cyberbully alone. Get an adult you trust!


-
#### Save the Evidence
* In certain cases where the cyberbullying is severe and requires more action than blocking the bully, you may have to save the evidence.
* Taking a screenshot of the conversation between you and the bully will help an adult investigate or share the information with someone
that can help.

-
#### Standing up for others
* When online, you may witness someone else being cyberbullied. What should you do?
* Pause and think about the situation. Sending a positive response to the person being cyberbullied can give them strength
and help them to feel better.
* Share with the person the step they should take to end the cyberbullying.
* If the cyberbullying is too severe, immediately go to an adult you trust for assistance.
