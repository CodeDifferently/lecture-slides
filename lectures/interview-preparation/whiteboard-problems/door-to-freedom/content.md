## How to solve
* To answer this question, you must have a decent understanding of _langauge_ and _grammar_
* We must first establish 5 parts of speech: `noun`, `verb`, `helping verb`, `predicate`, `subject`


-
## Nouns
* A _noun_ is a word used to identify a class of people, places, or things.
* the _subject_ of a sentence is always a _noun_.



-
## Verbs
* A _verb_ is used to describe an action, state, or occurrence
* The _main part_ of the predicate.


-
## Helping Verbs
* A _helping verb_ is a verb that is used to help better describe another verb.
* A _helping verb_ is an _inflected form_ of the phrase `to have` or `to be`
* An _form_ of _inflection_ of a verb is dependent on the _tense_
    * `past tense` - He _rowed_ the boat.
    * `past participle` - He _has rowed_ the boat.
    * `present participle` -  He _is rowing_ the boat.


-
## Predicates
* part of speech that says what a subject _is doing_.
    * We _are questioning_.
    * He _is baffled_.
    * They _were asking_.
    * He _has answered_.
