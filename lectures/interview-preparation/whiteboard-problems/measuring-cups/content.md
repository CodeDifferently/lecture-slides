## Setting the plot
* identify a process to measure EXACTLY 4 liters of water.
* Consider that you have the following at your dispense:
    * unlimited access to water
    * a 5-liter beaker
    * a 3-liter beaker

## Solution


-
### Step 0
* You begin with two empty beakers.
* Current state:
    * in the 5-liter beaker, precisely 0 liters of water.
    * in the 3-liter beaker, precisely 0 liters of water.

### Step 1
* The first step is to fill the 3-liter beaker to the brim.
* Current state:
    * in the 5-liter beaker, precisely 0 liters of water.
    * in the 3-liter beaker, precisely 3 liters of water.

### Step 2
* The second step is to fill the 5-liter beaker with the contents of the 3-liter beaker.
* Current state:
    * in the 5-liter beaker, precisely 3 liters of water.
    * in the 3-liter beaker, precisely 0 liters of water.
