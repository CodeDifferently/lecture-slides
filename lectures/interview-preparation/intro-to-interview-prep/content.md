## Objectives
* We will establish competence in the following categories
    * Social Tactics
    * Vocabulary
    * Algorithms
    * Whiteboarding

-
## Social Tactics
* Students will learn the importance of collaboration and collaborative attitudes during interview processes

-
## Vocabulary
* Students will establish fundamental vocabulary terms
* Students will learn fundamental data structures and their math counterparts
* Students will learn fundamental operations and their math counterparts

-
## Algorithms
* Students will learn how to effectively solve basic algorithms.
* Students will learn real-life examples of algorithms and their pseudo-code transliterations.

-
## White-boarding
* Students will learn ubiquitous syntax (conventions) when expressing on a whiteboard
* Students will learn how to express pseudo-code using conventions
* Students will learn how to build UMLs based on client specs

-
### Social Tactics
* Importance of collaboration; the Amigo-boat paradigm
* How to express "I do not know"

-
#### Importance of Collaboration
* Development jobs are never a solo effort
* There are always limits to your personal knowledge


-
#### Vocabulary
* Possessing technical skills but being unable to express them verbally is as good as not having technical skills at all
* Precision of language is _especially_ important in this field


-
#### White-boarding
* Being able to visually express one's mental processes is often considered one of the most critical methodologies for a _technical screen_.
